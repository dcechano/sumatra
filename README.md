# Sumatra

Sumatra is an (unfinished) JVM written in Rust. Sumatra targets Java SE 21 and endeavors to be fully compliant with the spec found [here](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se21/html/index.html).

Currently, Sumatra is a personal project and a personal challenge. While it is my goal to make Sumatra as production quality
as possible, it is not recommended to use in a production setting.

### Under Construction

The following are currently on the todo list:

- Implement arrays
- Implement garbage collection
- Implement a JNI
- Implement support for native functions (No JNI)
- Implement [Class file verification](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se21/html/jvms-4.html#jvms-4.10)
- Implement multithreading support
- Implement I/O
- Implement JIT
- Implement Java Exceptions
- Implement MORE TESTS!
